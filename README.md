## Setup and Installation

   Prerequisites
   
   1. Node.js (v16 or later)
   2. npm or yarn
   3. Expo CLI (npx expo-cli)
   4. Android Studio (for Android emulator) or Xcode (for iOS simulator)
   
   Steps to Run the App
   
   1. Install dependencies:
   
      ```bash
       npm install
      ```
   
   2. Start the Expo development server:
   
      ```bash
       npx expo start
      ```
   
   3. Run the app:
   
   1) On a physical device: Install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code.
   2) On an emulator:
         -For Android: Open Android Studio, start an emulator, and click "Run on Android device/emulator" in the Expo Developer Tools.
         -For iOS: Open Xcode, start a simulator, and click "Run on iOS simulator" in the Expo Developer Tools.

## Features Overview

   Core Features
   
   1. Journal Entries:
   Add, edit, and delete journal entries.
   Attach images to entries.
   Track moods (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Sad).
   
   2. Dashboard:
   Visualize mood trends using a pie chart.
   View journal entry frequency using a bar chart.
   
   3. Persistent Storage:
   Saves journal entries locally using AsyncStorage.

## Design Decisions and Architecture
   
   1. Data Persistence
      AsyncStorage is used to persist journal entries locally, ensuring data is retained even after the app is closed.
   
   2. Charts and Visualization
      react-native-chart-kit is used for rendering charts (pie and bar charts) to provide insights into user data.
   
   3. Routing
      expo-router is used for navigation, enabling a tab-based layout with screens for "Journal" and "Dashboard."

   4. Component-Based Architecture
      Context API is used for state management (JournalContext) to share data (e.g., journal entries) across components.
      The app is structured using reusable components like ThemedView, JournalProvider, and Dashboard.

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

   1. Known Limitations
      No Cloud Sync: Data is stored locally and cannot be synced across devices.
      
      Limited Mood Options: Only three moods (Happy, Neutral, Sad) are available.
   
   3. Future Improvements
      Cloud Integration: Add support for syncing data with cloud storage (e.g., Firebase).
      Custom Moods: Allow users to define their own moods.
      Search and Filters: Add functionality to search and filter journal entries by date or mood.
      Push Notifications: Remind users to log their daily entries.
      Theming: Supports light and dark modes.

## Third-Party Libraries

   1. Expo
   Why: Provides a streamlined development environment for React Native apps.
   Usage: Handles app bundling, QR code scanning, and device compatibility.

   2. react-native-chart-kit
   Why: Simplifies the creation of charts and visualizations.
   Usage: Used for rendering pie and bar charts in the Dashboard.

   3. AsyncStorage
   Why: Enables local data persistence.
   Usage: Stores journal entries and retrieves them on app startup.

   4. expo-router
   Why: Simplifies navigation in Expo apps.
   Usage: Implements tab-based navigation for "Journal" and "Dashboard" screens.
   
   5. expo-image-picker
   Why: Provides an easy way to select images from the device gallery.
   Usage: Allows users to attach images to journal entries.
