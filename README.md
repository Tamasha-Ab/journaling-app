## Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

`Node.js (v16 or later)
`npm or yarn
`Expo CLI (npx expo-cli)
`Android Studio (for Android emulator) or Xcode (for iOS simulator)

Steps to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/journaling-app.git
   cd journaling-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

4. Run the app:

*On a physical device: Install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code.
*On an emulator:
      -For Android: Open Android Studio, start an emulator, and click "Run on Android device/emulator" in the Expo Developer Tools.
      -For iOS: Open Xcode, start a simulator, and click "Run on iOS simulator" in the Expo Developer Tools.

## Features Overview

Core Features

Journal Entries:
Add, edit, and delete journal entries.
Attach images to entries.
Track moods (e.g., Happy, Neutral, Sad).

Dashboard:
Visualize mood trends using a pie chart.
View journal entry frequency using a bar chart.

Theming:
Supports light and dark modes.

Persistent Storage:
Saves journal entries locally using AsyncStorage.

## Design Decisions and Architecture

*Component-Based Architecture
   The app is structured using reusable components like ThemedView, JournalProvider, and Dashboard.

   Context API is used for state management (JournalContext) to share data (e.g., journal entries) across components.

*Data Persistence
AsyncStorage is used to persist journal entries locally, ensuring data is retained even after the app is closed.

*Charts and Visualization
react-native-chart-kit is used for rendering charts (pie and bar charts) to provide insights into user data.

*Routing
expo-router is used for navigation, enabling a tab-based layout with screens for "Journal" and "Dashboard."

## Known Limitations and Future Improvements

*Known Limitations
   No Cloud Sync: Data is stored locally and cannot be synced across devices.
   Limited Mood Options: Only three moods (Happy, Neutral, Sad) are available.

*Future Improvements
   Cloud Integration: Add support for syncing data with cloud storage (e.g., Firebase).
   Custom Moods: Allow users to define their own moods.
   Search and Filters: Add functionality to search and filter journal entries by date or mood.
   Push Notifications: Remind users to log their daily entries.

   ## Third-Party Libraries
   1. Expo
   Why: Provides a streamlined development environment for React Native apps.
   Usage: Handles app bundling, QR code scanning, and device compatibility.

   2. react-native-chart-kit
   Why: Simplifies the creation of charts and visualizations.
   Usage: Used for rendering pie and bar charts in the Dashboard.

   3. AsyncStorage
   Why: Enables local data persistence.
   Usage: Stores journal entries and retrieves them on app startup.

   4. expo-router
   Why: Simplifies navigation in Expo apps.
   Usage: Implements tab-based navigation for "Journal" and "Dashboard" screens.
   
   5. expo-image-picker
   Why: Provides an easy way to select images from the device gallery.
   Usage: Allows users to attach images to journal entries.
